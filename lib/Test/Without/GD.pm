=for stopwords Ryde Test-VariousBits libgd GD's fakery PNG JPEG GIF entrypoints XPM

=head1 NAME

Test::Without::GD - pretend GD is without some file formats

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # command line
 perl -MTest::Without::GD=-gif,-png myprog.pl ...

 # or in script
 use Test::Without::GD '-jpeg';

 # or by method
 use Test::Without::GD;
 Test::Without::GD->without_png();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module mangles the C<GD> module to pretend that some of its file
formats are not available, as can happen if libgd was built without some of
its supporting libraries, or some configs set in the C<GD> module, etc.

This can be used for testing to check how module code etc behaves without
some of GD's things, or to exercise F<.t> scripts to see that they skip
checks for features not available.

The mangling is done by deleting or replacing selected C<GD::Image> methods.
Deleting uses C<Sub::Delete> (perhaps that will change).  There's an
experimental C<no Test::Without::GD> which tries to restore C<GD::Image>
back to normal operation.  Is there any value in that?  Usually the fakery
will be for the duration of a script etc.

=head1 IMPORT OPTIONS

The module import recognises the following options

    -png
    -jpeg
    -gif
    -gifanim
    -xpm

They correspond to the C<without_png()> etc functions below.  So for example
to pretend PNG is not available,

    perl -MTest::Without::GD=-png myprog.pl ...

Or when using the usual C<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> harness,

    HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES="-MTest::Without::GD=-png" make test

The options can be applied from a script too (or the functions below used),

    use Test::Without::GD '-png';

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over

=item C<Test::Without::GD-E<gt>without_png()>

=item C<Test::Without::GD-E<gt>without_jpeg()>

=item C<Test::Without::GD-E<gt>without_gif()>

Pretend that PNG, JPEG or GIF format is not available.  This means removing
the respective C<GD::Image> methods,

    _newFromPng()    newFromPngData()   png()
    _newFromJpeg()   newFromJpegData()  jpeg()
    _newFromGif()    newFromGifData()   gif()

as is the case when GD is built without C<HAVE_PNG>, C<HAVE_JPEG> or
C<HAVE_GIF>.

The documented entrypoints C<newFromPng()>, C<newFromJpeg()> and
C<newFromGif()> in fact remain, but their underlying C<_newFromPng()> etc
are removed causing them to die.

=item C<Test::Without::GD-E<gt>without_gifanim()>

Pretend that animated GIF support is not available.  This means replacing
C<GD::Image> methods

    gifanimbegin(), gifanimadd(), gifanimend()

with instead

    sub {
      die "libgd 2.0.33 or higher required for animated GIF support";
    }

as is the case when GD is built without C<HAVE_ANIMGIF>.

=item C<Test::Without::GD-E<gt>without_xpm()>

Pretend that XPM format is not available.  This means replacing C<GD::Image>
method

    newFromXpm()

with instead

    sub {
      $@ = "libgd was not built with xpm support\n";
      return;
    }

as is the case when GD is built without C<HAVE_XPM>.
