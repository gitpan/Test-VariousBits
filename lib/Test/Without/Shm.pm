=head1 NAME

Test::Without::Shm - simulate shmget() etc not available

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # pretend shm not implemented on the system
 perl -MTest::Without::Shm myprog.pl ...

 # pretend not enough memory for shm
 perl -MTest::Without::Shm=-nomem myprog.pl ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module overrides the Perl core functions

    shmget()
    shmread()
    shmwrite()
    shmctl()

to pretend that their System-V style shared memory is either not implemented
or there's not enough memory.

This fakery can be used for testing to check how module code etc might
behave on a system without shm or when there's not enough memory.  A module
might throw an error, use an I/O fallback, etc.

The shm functions are overridden using the C<CORE::GLOBAL> mechanism (see
L<CORE/OVERRIDING CORE FUNCTIONS>) so C<Test::Without::Shm> must be loaded
before compiling any code which might call them.

=head1 COMMAND LINE

The default import behaviour is to pretend shm is not implemented on the
system.  C<-M> can be used on the command line to run a program,

    perl -MTest::Without::Shm myprog.pl ...

Or the C<-nomem> option pretends that shm exists, but there's not enough
memory,

    perl -MTest::Without::Shm=-nomem myprog.pl ...

For the usual C<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> harness the C<-M> can be put in the
C<HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES> environment variable in the usual way,

    HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES="-MTest::Without::Shm" make test

=head1 IMPORTS

The same effect as the above C<-M> can be had in a script,

    use Test::Without::Shm;   # shm not implemented

or for C<-nomem>

    use Test::Without::Shm '-nomem';

If you want to load the C<Test::Without::Shm> module but not activate it
then give a C<()> in the usual way to skip its C<import()> method,

    # setups, but no "without" yet
    use Test::Without::Shm ();

Don't forget as noted above that this must be done before any code using the
C<shm...()> functions, which probably means somewhere early in the mainline
script.

The import options are

=over

=item C<-notimp>

Make shm "not implemented", as if the system doesn't have the underlying
functions.  This makes the Perl functions croak with "shmget not
implemented", or "shm I/O not implemented", etc.

=item C<-nomem>

Make C<shmget()> fail with C<ENOMEM> as if the system says there's not
enough memory to make a shm segment.  This is arranged even when the system
doesn't have shm (ie. when "not implemented" would be the normal state).

=back

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over

=item C<$mode = Test::Without::Shm-E<gt>mode ()>

=item C<Test::Without::Shm-E<gt>mode ($mode)>

Get or set the shm fakery mode.  C<$mode> is a string

    "notimp"
    "nomem"
    "normal"

Normal mode means the C<shm...()> functions are Perl's normal behaviour,
whatever that might be.  In the current implementation this is done by
leaving the C<CORE::GLOBAL> setups installed but dispatching to the actual
C<CORE::shm...()> routines.
