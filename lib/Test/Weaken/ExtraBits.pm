=head1 NAME

Test::Weaken::ExtraBits -- various extras for Test::Weaken

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Test::Weaken::ExtraBits;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a few helper functions for use with C<Test::Weaken>.

=head1 EXPORTS

Nothing is exported by default, but the functions can be requested
individually in the usual C<Exporter> style (see L<Exporter>).

    use Test::Weaken::ExtraBits qw(ignore_Class_Singleton);

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 Contents

=over

=item C<$io = Test::Weaken::ExtraBits::contents_glob_IO ($ref)>

If C<$ref> is a globref then return the contents of its C<IO> slot.  This is
the underlying Perl I/O of a file handle.

Note that C<Test::Weaken> 3.006 doesn't track IO objects by default so to
detect leaks of them add to C<tracked_types> too,

   leaks (constructor => sub { ... },
          contents => \&Test::Weaken::ExtraBits::contents_glob_IO,
          tracked_types => ['IO']);

This is good for detecting an open file leaked through a Perl-level dup (see
L<perlfunc/open>) even after its original C<$fh> handle is destroyed and
freed.

   open my $dupfh, '<', $fh;
   # $dupfh holds and uses *$fh{IO}

=item C<$bool = Test::Weaken::ExtraBits::ignore_global_functions ($ref)>

Return true if C<$ref> is a coderef to a global function like

    sub foo {}

A global function is identified by the C<$ref> having a name and the current
function under that name equal to this C<$ref>.  Plain functions created as
C<sub foo {}> etc work, but redefinitions or function-creating modules like
C<Memoize> or C<constant> generally don't.

The name in a coderef is essentially just a string from its original
creation.  Things like C<Memoize> etc often end up with anonymous functions.
C<constant> only ends up with a name in the symtab optimization case.

See L<Sub::Name> to add a name to a coderef, though you probably wouldn't
want that merely to make C<ignore_global_functions()> work.  (Though a name
can help C<caller()> and stack backtraces too.)

=item C<$bool = ignore_functions ($ref, $funcname, $funcname, ...)>

Return true if C<$ref> is a coderef to any of the given named functions.
This is designed for use when making an ignore handler,

    sub my_ignore_callback {
      my ($ref) = @_;
      return (ignore_functions ($ref, 'Foo::Bar::somefunc',
                                      'Quux::anotherfunc')
              || ...);
    }         

Each C<$funcname> argument should be a fully-qualified string like
C<Foo::Bar::somefunc>.  Any functions which doesn't exist are skipped, so it
doesn't matter if a particular package is loaded yet, etc.

If you've got coderefs to functions you want to ignore then there's no need
for C<ignore_functions()>, just test C<$ref==$mycoderef> etc.

=item C<$bool = Test::Weaken::ExtraBits::ignore_Class_Singleton ($ref)>

Return true if C<$ref> is the singleton instance object of a class using
C<Class::Singleton>.  If C<Class::Singleton> is not loaded or not used by
the C<$ref> object then return false.

Generally C<Class::Singleton> objects are permanent, existing for the
duration of the program.  This ignore helps skip them.

The current implementation requires C<Class::Singleton> version 1.04 for its
C<has_instance()> method.

=item C<$bool = Test::Weaken::ExtraBits::ignore_DBI_globals ($ref)>

Return true if C<$ref> is one of the various C<DBI> module global objects.

This is slightly dependent on the DBI implementation but currently means any
C<DBI::dr> driver object.  A driver object is created permanently for each
driver loaded.  C<DBI::db> handles (created and destroyed in the usual way)
refer to their respective driver object.

A bug in Perl through to at least 5.10.1 related to lvalue C<substr()> means
certain scratchpad temporaries holding "ImplementorClass" strings in DBI end
up still alive after C<DBI::db> and C<DBI::st> objects have finished with
them, looking like leaks, but not.  They aren't recognised by
C<ignore_DBI_globals> currently.  A workaround is to do a dummy C<DBI::db>
handle creation to flush out the old scratchpad.
